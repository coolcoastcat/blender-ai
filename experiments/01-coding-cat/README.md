# Experiment 1: The Coding Calico

This experiment creates a simple animation of a calico cat named Jynx relaxing with a laptop. The script demonstrates:

- Basic shape creation in Blender
- Material creation for the calico fur pattern
- Simple animation with keyframes
- Scene setup with lighting and camera positioning

## Running the Script

1. Open Blender
2. Switch to the Scripting workspace
3. Create a new text file
4. Paste the contents of `animation.py`
5. Click "Run Script"

## Features

- Procedurally generated cat model using basic shapes
- Calico fur pattern using noise textures
- Animated tail swishing
- Laptop prop
- Basic scene lighting and camera setup
- Cat should look like: [cutsie cat](cutsie-cat.jpg)

## Results

The animation renders a 50-frame sequence showing Jynx the calico cat with a gently swishing tail, positioned with a laptop.

## Future Improvements

- Add more detailed fur texturing
- Improve the cat's model with better proportions
- Add screen glow effect to the laptop
- Include more complex animations (breathing, ear twitching)
