# Blender Animation Development Session

## Initial Setup
- Created basic repository structure
- Set up README.md with project description
- Created first experiment branch `experiment-1`

## Development Iterations
Total iterations: 12 major adjustments
1. Initial cat and laptop creation (5 iterations)

5. Smile positioning and rotation attempts (4 iterations)
   - Tried X axis rotation
   - Tried Y axis rotation
   - Tried Z axis rotation
   - Attempted various tilt adjustments

## Cat Animation Development
Started developing a script to create an animated calico cat with a laptop. Key development steps:

### Basic Cat Structure
1. Created basic cat body using primitive shapes
2. Added detailed features:
   - Big round eyes with shine
   - Pointier ears
   - Tail with swishing animation
   - Legs and paws
   - Smile curve

### Laptop Creation
1. Created laptop components:
   - Base
   - Screen with glow effect
   - Keyboard surface
2. Adjusted laptop positioning and rotation
3. Fixed visibility issues
4. Positioned laptop relative to cat

### Animation Features
1. Added typing animation for paws
2. Implemented tail swishing
3. Added breathing animation
4. Created leg movements to follow paws

### Material Development
1. Created calico fur pattern using:
   - Noise textures
   - Color mixing
   - Fur properties
2. Added screen glow for laptop
3. Applied materials selectively to objects

### Fine-tuning
Made various adjustments to:
- Smile position and rotation
- Cat proportions
- Laptop angle and position
- Animation timing
- Material properties

### Animation Timing Updates
Made significant timing adjustments:
1. Extended animation length from 2 seconds to 10 seconds
   - Changed from 50 frames to 240 frames (24fps)
   - Adjusted all animation loops accordingly
2. Modified animation frequencies for longer duration:
   - Slowed down tail swishing (0.2 → 0.1)
   - Reduced breathing frequency (0.1 → 0.05)
   - Adjusted typing speeds (0.8/0.6 → 0.4/0.3)
3. Added complete camera rotation
   - 360-degree orbit around cat
   - Smooth circular motion
   - Maintained slight up/down movement
   - Camera tracking focused on cat's body

## Technical Details
- Used Blender's Python API
- Implemented proper object handling
- Added debug prints for troubleshooting
- Created modular functions for different components

## Final Result
Created a scene featuring:
- Animated calico cat
- Laptop with glowing screen
- Natural movements (typing, breathing, tail swishing)
- Proper materials and lighting
