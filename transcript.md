# Blender Animation Development Session

## Initial Setup
- Created basic repository structure
- Set up README.md with project description
- Created first experiment branch `experiment-1`

## Development Iterations
Total iterations: 12 major adjustments
1. Initial cat and laptop creation (2 iterations)
2. Laptop visibility fixes (1 iteration)
3. Laptop positioning relative to cat (3 iterations)
4. Cat leg and paw positioning (2 iterations)
5. Smile positioning and rotation attempts (4 iterations)
   - Tried X axis rotation
   - Tried Y axis rotation
   - Tried Z axis rotation
   - Attempted various tilt adjustments

## Cat Animation Development
Started developing a script to create an animated calico cat with a laptop. Key development steps:

### Basic Cat Structure
1. Created basic cat body using primitive shapes
2. Added detailed features:
   - Big round eyes with shine
   - Pointier ears
   - Tail with swishing animation
   - Legs and paws
   - Smile curve

### Laptop Creation
1. Created laptop components:
   - Base
   - Screen with glow effect
   - Keyboard surface
2. Adjusted laptop positioning and rotation
3. Fixed visibility issues
4. Positioned laptop relative to cat

### Animation Features
1. Added typing animation for paws
2. Implemented tail swishing
3. Added breathing animation
4. Created leg movements to follow paws

### Material Development
1. Created calico fur pattern using:
   - Noise textures
   - Color mixing
   - Fur properties
2. Added screen glow for laptop
3. Applied materials selectively to objects

### Fine-tuning
Made various adjustments to:
- Smile position and rotation
- Cat proportions
- Laptop angle and position
- Animation timing
- Material properties

## Technical Details
- Used Blender's Python API
- Implemented proper object handling
- Added debug prints for troubleshooting
- Created modular functions for different components

## Final Result
Created a scene featuring:
- Animated calico cat
- Laptop with glowing screen
- Natural movements (typing, breathing, tail swishing)
- Proper materials and lighting
