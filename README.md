AI genned Blender animations

This repository contains experiments with generating Python scripts for Blender animations. The goal is to explore different approaches to programmatically creating animations in Blender using AI assistance.

## Experiments

The experiments will focus on:
- Generating Python scripts that create and animate 3D objects in Blender
- Exploring different animation techniques and effects
- Testing various approaches to procedural animation generation
- Documenting the results and learnings from each experiment

## Structure

Each experiment will be organized in its own directory with:
- The Python script for Blender
- Documentation of the approach and results
- Any additional resources or references used

## Getting Started

To run these experiments, you'll need:
- Blender (latest stable version recommended)
- Python 3.x
- Basic understanding of Blender's Python API

More details will be added as experiments progress.
